# Star Wars using Chainmail + OD&D House Rules

This game uses my [(Chainmail + OD&D House Rules)](https://github.com/jacksonbenete/chainmail-houserules) as a base for some changes.

I've reasoned that the three OD&D classes works very well to address Star Wars troupes.

Don't let the "fantasy class names" turns you away yet, I've chose to keep the names to make easy the comparisons and reason behind the rules, as this is as much a guide as it is an explanation of how to use the house rules.
I will also be using the term "Spell" as a way to address "Force Use" or "Force Powers" for the sake of comparison between the games.

When I say lightsaber, other "light" weapons like lightwhip are included.

The game assumes a character progression from level 1 to 3, as in Holmes' Basic Edition. This will makes sense in the Save and Combat Section. The system can hold to characters of level up to 5, but the Combat and Save will break for any higher levels.

Boxed text are rules included on the Chainmail + OD&D House Rules or design discussions that can be ignored.

# [0] Terminology and Dices

**Creature**: means a non-player character. It can be a soldier, an alien, a monster or a citizen.

**AC**: means Armor Class. A lower AC means a better protection.

**HD**: means Hit Die or Hit Dices, it is equal the character or creature level, and determines how many hits a creature needs to be killed. Characters can normally receive more hits than what is determined by their HD.

**Save**: means Saving Throw, is a way of testing how good a character did in a task or if the character can avoid a danger or damage. You will be using 2d6 for this.

**Roll**: for combat, you can use 1d20, 2d10 or 3d6 as desired. They offer different probabilities but when used in the optimized AC range of house rules all three works just ok.

# [1] Character Creation

## Background

We don't have a list for this. Because we don't need one.

For Background we're talking about Race, the character past life, and the character concept.

A "Coruscant Noble", a "Smuggler Droid" or a "Mon Calamari Scout" are good Backgrounds, we don't need more than a few words for it.

## Character Classes

As in the old game we have three character classes: Fighter, Magic-User and Cleric.

Not every Jedi is very strong using the Force. Some Mercenaries and Mandalorians can fight as good as a Master Jedi. Those are Fighters.

Some Sith as Palpatine are not as good on lightsaber duel as other Force Users, but they're strong in the Dark Side. There are Witches, other tribes, factions or races that are also very strong on Sorcery. Those are Magic-Users.

Clerics always was kind of a half-way between Fighters and Magic-Users. Here could fit the majority of the Force Users.

## Alignment

Being a Sith, Jedi or other Faction is a matter of alignment (Law, Neutral, Chaos) and Character Background.

```
The player character don't have to be part of any Faction or political view, but he might get caught into factions struggle causing them problems anyways.
```

## Attributes

3d6 in order, receiving a single "swap" in the end.

| Score | Bonus |
|-----------|-|
| 3-8	| -1|
| 9-12	| 0|
| 13+	| +1|

```
During character creation:
- A Intelligence of 13+ gives you an additional language;
- A Constitution of 13+ gives you +1 HP for HD.
- A Charisma of 13+ gives you a starting retainer.

This starting retainer rule for a high charisma, as explained in house rules, is a way to help my players to get used to controlling and caring for more than one character. 
This starting retainer could be a padawan/apprentice, or a faithful ally (Chewbacca).

Apart from character creation bonuses:
- The attribute bonuses of +1 or -1 apply on Saving Throw (more on this later); 
- The charisma bonus would apply on Reactions; 
- The +1 constitution would help on recovery at long rest (more about character HP and recovery later).
```

## Languages

Every character start being able to talk a "common" language, or have a device to help into it, and can **understand** one additional language. This can be the "droid language" like how some characters can understand R2D2, or can be an Alien Language as the relationship of Han Solo and Chewbacca.

Finally, a Intelligence 13+ character will receive another language, he will be able to speak or only understand it depending if the language is speakable for his race/anatomy.

# [2] Character Classes

```
Is hard to give titles to character classes since it depends more on the character background an faction instead of class.
```

## Fighter

- Sum their HD to Hit.
- Subtract their HD in their AC while using Lightsaber or Beskar weapons.
- Can attack as many times as their HD in a turn using any weapon.
- If Force-sensitive, need a Save to use Force Powers.

```
This guarantee that a character can be a good "Fighter" doesn't matter if it's a mercenary or a jedi. 
A recurrent problem in Star Wars games is that Jedi's are normally too much strong compared to other classes, but here if you have a scoundrel or a mandalorian as your character, you can do just good against any Jedi, just like in the movies, comics and tv series.
```

|HD|Fighter|Exp|
|---|---|---|
|1|---|0|
|2|---|2000|
|3|---|4000|

## Magic-User

- Subtract their HD in their AC while using Lightsaber.
- Can cast 2 spells per HD per day.

```
I don't know if this might be the most controversial adaptation of if it will be the Cleric. 
If they're still Jedi/Sith, they still know how to use a lightsaber, so they should at least survive a little, but they don't fight back as much. 
That's why they receive the AC bonus but not the To Hit bonus.

Sorry for the use of "spell" instead of "force power" but I think this helps to make it clear in Chainmail/OD&D terms.
```

|HD|Magic-User|Exp|
|---|---|---|
|1|---|0|
|2|---|2500|
|3|---|5000|

## Cleric

- Sum their HD to hit.
- Subtract their HD in their AC while using Lightsaber.
- Can cast 1 spell per HD per day.

```
I think that a "Cleric" is a good example of a normal Jedi. 
Can fight just good, and can save their own skin (or others) sometimes by using one or two spells.
```

|HD|Cleric|Exp|
|---|---|---|
|1|---|0|
|2|---|1500|
|3|---|3000|

# [3] Combat, Damage and Save

## Save
The Saving Throw uses 2d6 as in Chainmail.

The base Save is 10+, meaning they need 10 or more on 2d6 to succeed.

The Save will also benefit from the Character HD, using it as a +HD modifier.

As in house rules, the Referee might allow, or ask for, a modifier based in one of the character attributes.

Finally, the Referee might allow a +1 modifier depending of the Character Background or Concept.

```
I use a Save not only for avoiding damage on special situations, but for any "skill" test as well. 
I thought that adding the abilities modifiers and a background bonus would be enough to simulate a "skill", so we can call for a Save when it's not clear if the character would know or succeed in something.
```

## To Hit and Armour

To hit a target, roll Combat Dice + HD + AC and if the result is equal 20 or better, it is a hit.

There is three armor categories, Light (AC 9), Heavy (AC 7) and Armored (AC 5).

**Example**:
- Base: AC 9; Trooper Armor: AC 7; Mandalorian Armor: AC 5.
- Clothes counts as Base AC or Light.
- Any other (Medium or) Heavy Armor would be equivalent to Trooper Armor.
- Darth Vader's Armor would be equivalent to a Mandalorian Armor, AC 5.

The Combat Dice can be 1d20, 2d10 or 3d6 as desired by the Referee.

As anyone using a Lightsaber, or a Fighter using Beskar weapons, can also use it to deflect blaster shoots and to parry attacks, the character's HD will "fix" the character's Base AC. The final AC will be either the character HD or the armor AC which was better. 

**Example**: 
- A HD 2 Mandalorian Fighter would have a (9-2) AC 7 using no armor, AC 7 using a Trooper Armor or equivalent, and AC 5 using his Mandalorian Armor.
- A HD 3 Mandalorian Fighter would have a (9-3) AC 6 using no armor, AC 6 using a Trooper Armor or equivalent since the character defensive skills are better than the Trooper Armor protection, and AC 5 using his Mandalorian Armor, since the Mandalorian Armor still better than the character defensive skills.

## Damage, HD and HP

On a Hit, the character roll 1d6 for damage, on 6 it will cause 2 damage (or remove two HD from the creature), else it will cause 1 damage.

This is the same to say that on a Hit the character causes 1 damage, then roll a damage dice to cause an extra damage on a 6.

Each damage caused will remove one HD from a creature. Meaning that HD 1 creatures will die in one hit, just like droids and troopers are dying all the time.

```
Some creatures can have more "HP" (or "HTK", hits to kill if you prefer) than it's HD, for a better challenge.

Player characters on the other hand roll their HP on the Character Creation, and each time they level up they roll 1d6 for each HD, the result will be their new HP if it's greater than their previous HP.

This greater HP is about the force, their luck in surviving more than the average, and to mitigate the high number of troops and droid blasters aiming on them all the time during the game.
```

When the character's HP drops to zero, it need to Save against Death, or else the character is dead. The Save is the Force doing it's thing. Even a powerful Jedi Master die sometimes for a blaster shoot, but a Sith Apprentice thought long dead can appear again showing that sometimes they succeed their Saves.

## Parry and Deflect

The character already parry attacks as part of it's defense. That's why the character HD is used to correct it's AC.

To allow advanced moves, the better approach is to gamble.

This decision is in order to put some challenge into it as well as to avoid slowing down the combat with players asking to parry or deflect all the time, as the characters aren't succeeding in deflect all the time in the tv and comics as well.

If the character wants to parry an attack in order to disarm the attacker, the character roll To Hit. If the roll total is greater than the creature total, the character succeed in disarm the creature, but in a fail the character will be the one disarmed.

To deflect blaster the character roll To Hit. If the roll total is greater than the shooter total, the character succeed in deflect the blaster shoot back (or to redirect it), but in a fail the character will suffer damage even if the blaster shoot would not hit it's AC in the beginning.

## Creatures, Weapons and Special Abilities

Some weapons can be stronger than others.

A 2-handed lightsaber can inflict damage in a 5 or 6 instead of in a 6 on the damage roll.

A heavy gun can inflict damage in a 5 or 6.

Other stronger guns could inflict damage in 4-6 instead, or even 2d6 damage.

```
In Star Wars, healing is not a problem as it is in The Age of Conan. 
The characters might have medkits, med bays, med droids or even a Jedi Master with healing powers around.

The Referee must design encounters with creatures using powerful weapons and combat skills to mitigate the higher hp pools of the characters, creating some challenge.
```

Remember that creatures can also fit into classes. Sometimes a Droid or a mercenary will count as a Fighter 3 attacking 3 times in a round, and a Sith Lord will be of HD 5 having some devastating Lightning Bolts doing as much as their HD of dices in damage.

```
The creatures doesn't have to be of HD 1~3 like the characters, and they can have special abilities that the characters don't have, like multiple attacks while in water, or to spit venom or acid, and the like.

Sometimes a HD 2 creature will endure three attacks instead of 2. 
I normally roll 1d6 and give it one more hit (hp) in a 6. 
Sometimes I just design a HD 2 creature to attack with +2, but with 5 HP as if it was HD 5 instead.
```

# [4] Force-Sensitive, Force Powers and Spells

*This whole chapter is incomplete*

I think the traditional "spells per day" approach can work just well for a Star Wars game.

If we think about it, the characters aren't using Force all the time, and in situations where they could easily address a problem by using Force Powers they don't. It could be just like as their "uses per day" was used.

In a situation where the Referee think the player character could still use their Force Power or a Spell, like if the character is Force-sensitive like a Padawan/Jedi but a Fighter, or if the Spells per day already exhausted, the character might roll a Save.

This makes sense because there were moments when the characters on tv/comics tried to use their Force Powers but failed, so a Save for "additional" uses can work just well. 

If a character fail more times than it's HD the Referee can determine a -1 in all Rolls until the next Rest, as a way to show that the character got exhausted trying to abuse the force, and to avoid abuse for players wanting to roll all the time for additional uses.

In later Star Wars we have Witches or Sorcerers as well, that use "Force Powers" a little different than we knew in episode 4~6. So I think it's just ok to use some "RPG Spells" as Force Powers.

We can fit some Classic Spells that appeared in tv and comics... 
- The "hand wave" movement is pretty much a Charm Person. 
- Speak with Animals would work as well.
- We can think of Siths using "Lightning Bolts" or "Ray of Enfeeblement". 
- I can think of some "Detect", "Locate", "Divination" and "ESP" like spells that was used in some moments. 
- "Commune" when they're on meditation.
- Defensive use of force can be as Shield, Hold Portal, "Wall of"...
- Knock, as I remember Obiwan unlocking things using force.
- Fear can fit just right.
- I remember something like both Curse and Bless being used.
- Telekinesis, Hold Person, Hold Monster, Repulsion and Animate Objects.
- Find the Path.
- Projected Image.
- Contact Higher Plane.
- Raise Dead was used in Dathomir.
- I think I remember them putting people to **Sleep** as well.
- Something like Levitate or Fly to mimic great Leaps or the "Feather Fall" effect.

Some spells are of too high level comparing with others that could do something alike or comparing with what is used in Star Wars.
- We could adapt Sleep to use it as a "Push" 2d8 hd creatures away instead of putting them to sleep... "Repulsion" is a level 6 spell, I think it's a too high level for something not so extraordinary. If you can put 2d8 creatures to sleep on level 1, you should be able to push/knockout them as well in the same level.
- Find the Path is a Sixth Level Cleric Spell, but the Force is guiding even Level 1 Padawans some times.
- Knock is a level 2 spell, but people will be "unlocking" by lightsaber all the time.
- Droids or gadgets can "read languages" (or translate your voice).

Workarounds:
- Reallocate Spells into new lists redesigning their "levels".
- Instead of limiting spells by character level, we could use a Complexity Save just like in Chainmail for the character to try a higher level Spell.

The Referee could be able to create more "Spells", adapt it from comics/tv or to work with the player into creating new effects or adapting it from other RPG sources.

# [5] Ships and Space Combat

*This chapter needs more thoughts on it*

This set of rules was designed using a slot system like the one used for items on the house rules.

We have three classes of ships: Light, Heavy Cargo, Armored Cruiser.

The Base AC for the Ship is AC 9.

**Class 1 - Light**
- 1~6 slots

**Class 2 - Heavy**
- 2~12 slots

**Class 3 - Armored**
- 3~18 slots

## Slot System

One slot must be for a Cabin (one slot, but two passengers), or a Bridge (two slots, crew of five characters).
The Cabin or Bridge will always occupy the first slot(s).

One slot must be for the engine. It will always occupy the last slot.

You can use a slot for an additional engine, part, ability or special room.

If you want to jump, you need to use a slot for a jump drive.

A Shield Module can only be installed once, it reduces the ship Base AC by 2.

One Engine is mandatory, but each extra engine increases the ship speed thus reducing the ship AC by 1.

Each gun installed gives a ship one attack per round.

A Droid, or a Combat Module, gives a +1 To Hit.

On each hit taken, roll 1d6, 2d6 or 3d6 depending of the ship size, the result will be where the shoot hit on the ship.

## Example of Ship and Combat

**X-wing**:
- [1] Cabin
- [2] Droid Module
- [3] Turret (Gun)
- [4] Turret (Gun)
- [5] Shield Module
- [6] Engine

The X-Wing AC is 7 (Base 9, -2 from the Shield Module).

It can shoot twice per turn (two Turret guns installed) with +1 to hit (droid aid).

On a combat, the X-wing got hit once, the damage dice roll for a 4 result, so one of the Turrets got destroyed and the X-wing will attack only once per turn.

In the next round the X-wing got hit, the damage dice roll for a 4 result again, the Turret is already destroyed so the damage move to the next slot, which is slot 5: Shield Module. The Shield Module is gone.

After some rounds the X-wing got hit again, the damage dice roll for a 1 result, the cabin exploded and the Ship is gone, the pilot dead.

If the Engine got hit instead, the character would make a Save, a success means that the engine is gone and the ship will fall or needs to land as emergency in a planet nearby. A fail means that the engine exploded and the ship with it.

If a Ship have multiple Engines, each one have a chance of 1-in-6 to explode the next. If all engines are gone, you need a Save as describe above.
